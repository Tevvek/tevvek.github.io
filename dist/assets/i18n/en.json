Then again, when I was 11 years old we moved again to Barcelona, Catalonia. My live was already crazy at such young age but I am glad all that happened because it made me person I am today. So welcome to my resume, I wish you enjoy it and think deeply your next phone call, because it may be me, or it may be not, but then I guess, you'd lose a great worker!"
